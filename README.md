# airfoil_simulator
A Navier-Stokes solver for simulating airflow over airfoils. Built using Unity and C#.

Project supports Joukowsky, NACA 4-digit, NACA 4-digit modified, NACA 5-digit, and NACA 6-digit airfoils.
Joukowsky airfoils also have an option to display analytic solutions for surrounding velocity, pressure, and streamlines.
